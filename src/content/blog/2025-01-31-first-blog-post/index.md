This is a first blog post for my Astro portfolio & blog website.

I deployed this in a day for a job application, as a companion to my GitHub profile, and a light and lightweight way to showcase my projects and introduce myself a bit more.

I used an existing Astro template (thank you <a href="https://devaradise.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Syakir @ Devaradise</a>!), tweaked it in some parts and added my content.

Later, I plan to build my own customized blog with Astro from scratch and migrate the content there.

Stay tuned for more content in the future!
